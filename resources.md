<b><em>Shared facilities at Clemson</em>:</b><br>
<b>Advanced Materials Innovation Complex (AMIC)</b><br>
<a href="https://cecas.clemson.edu/amic/">AMIC</a> is a proposed new building that establishes Clemson University as a serious R-1 institution in support of the Clemson Elevate strategic plan. It will be the University’s most technologically advanced facility. Our lab will begin to move to AMIC at the end of 2025.<br>
<br>
<b>Advanced Materials Research Laboratory (AMRL)</b><br>
<a href="https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/research/facilities.html">AMRL</a> is an innovative campus and technology park located in Anderson, South Carolina. It is a state-of-the-art facility that houses internationally recognized research programs in optoelectronics, chemistry, and materials science. It houses the nation’s most outstanding <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/research/division-of-research/core-facilities/emf/capabilities/index.html">Electron Microscopy Facilities (EMF)</a> and <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/comset/index.html">Center for Optical Materials Science and Engineering Technologies (COMSET)</a>, offering professional services to private industry and academic clients. Ready access to transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), raman spectroscopy, and many others.<br>
<br>
<b>MSE Characterization and Processing Center</b><br>
Our department provides analytical and physical testing, manufacturing, fiber extrusion, and processing support and services. Ready access to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, and many others.<br>
<br>
<b>Palmetto High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster</b><br>
<a href="https://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/palmetto/">Palmetto Cluster</a> infrastructure integrates world-class provisions in high-performance computing, high-performance networks, data visualization, storage architectures, and middleware. All Clemson researchers can use and receive training on the Palmetto Cluster for free. It is comprised of 1786 compute nodes, totaling 34916 CPU cores. The second iteration, Palmetto 2, has 50 H100 GPUs for AI/ML capabilities.<br>
<br>
<b>Chemistry Instrumentation Facility</b><br>
The Department of Chemistry hosts a <a href="https://scienceweb.clemson.edu/aif/">shared instrumentation facility</a> available to the faculty for research and teaching. Ready access to X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and many others.<br>
