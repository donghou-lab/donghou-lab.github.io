<b>Research Theme</b><br>
We envision pioneering solutions to the grand challenges at the crossroads of materials, energy, and sustainability. By harnessing the power of advanced characterization and multi-scale analysis, our research seeks to reveal the fundamental principles governing materials behavior and to engineer next-generation materials that drive innovation in nanoscience, ceramic engineering, and energy technologies. Through this vision, we aspire to advance sustainable technologies that shape a cleaner, smarter, and more resilient future.<br>
&bull;&nbsp;Characterization: in situ, operando, multi-modal, multi-dimensional<br>
&bull;&nbsp;Crystallography: diffraction and scattering<br>
&bull;&nbsp;Energy science: batteries, catalysts, fuel cells<br>
&bull;&nbsp;Nanomaterials: multifunctional multicomponent alloys and ceramics<br>

<b>Funded Research Projects</b><br>
<!-- <img src="/assets/misc/placeholder_wide.jpg" alt="placeholder_wide"><br> -->
&bull;&nbsp;<b>NSF EPSCoR Research Fellowship</b>: Through this fellowship, we will develop advanced analytical methods to uncover the fundamental design principles of solid-state batteries. The project focuses on addressing interfacial challenges by optimizing the microstructural and chemical design of composite electrodes. In collaboration with the national synchrotron facility, we will also strengthen Clemson University’s research infrastructure in X-ray imaging. Furthermore, this fellowship will serve as a platform to train and inspire the next generation of materials scientists in energy research and advanced characterization techniques.<br>

<br>
&bull;&nbsp;<b>SC EPSCoR Grants for Applications in Industry and Networking (GAIN)</b>: Through this grant, we aim to enhance the performance and longevity of critical components in implantable biomedical devices by integrating data-driven modeling with AI-enabled methodologies. This award is part of the NSF-funded "<u>ADAPT in SC</u>" initiative (AI-Enabled Devices for the Advancement of Personalized and Transformative Health Care in South Carolina). The overarching goal is to strengthen research capacity at the intersection of AI, life and social sciences, and bioengineering: advancing fundamental research, education, workforce development, and industry collaboration.<br>
<br>
&bull;&nbsp;<b>CU-SRNL ELI Collaboration Initiatives</b>: This grant enables the acquisition of an Xradia Versa system to strengthen research collaboration between Clemson University and the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). In partnership with SRNL’s Advanced Manufacturing Collaborative (AMC), we will focus on 3D multi-scale inspection and compositional control of additively manufactured parts, as well as the design and regulation of interfaces between immiscible materials in composite systems. This effort is a key component of the AMIC Imaging Facility initiative, supporting Clemson University’s bold strategic vision for 2035.<br>
