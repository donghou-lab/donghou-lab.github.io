<strong>2024 Fall</strong><br>
Some good words by the students in the MSE3010 evaluation. I'm flattered. Merci!<br>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>"In lectures with Dr. Hou, he was clear in his explanation of concepts."</li>
    <li>"The instructor is very good at teaching the material and giving feedback on the reports."</li>
    <li>"Hou was polite and decent at lecturing. He was happy to answer questions even if the class was not always super interested in the course material ... His lectures were my favorite of the course. I would recommend him to someone taking the lab lectures."</li>
    <li>"I think everything was very organized and helped my learning."</li>
    <li>"There were a few fun labs during this course. The inorganic labs that dealt with ceramic processing and mechanical testing were extremely fun and really helped students to understand more about the course and the practices of engineers in industry."</li>
  </ul>

&bull;&nbsp;Dr. Hou organized a symposium "Energy Storage Systems: In-Situ Characterization Studies", with Dr. Yijin Liu from UT Austin. The symposium was hosted at ACS Spring 2024 meeting for Energy and Fuels Division (ENFL) in New Orleans, LA.<br>
&bull;&nbsp;With a theme of "Many Flavors of Chemistry", this conference has 29 technical divisions, 11779 accepted abstracts, including 7389 oral and 4390 poster presentations. We thoroughly enjoyed the conference.<br>
