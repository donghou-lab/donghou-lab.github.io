Some good words by the students in the MSE 3020 evaluation. Grazieeee!<br>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Dr. Hou does a good job of communicating what is expected to use. He is easy to understand in lecture and is very willing to help with any lab report questions. His feedback on the lab reports has, also, been very help allowing us to know how to make the next one better.</li>
    <li>I enjoy all the labs and I enjoyed all the experience I have gained from this class. He enjoys his job and it shows. He is very smart and wants us to gain a lot of experience with the equipment we used in the labs. Even though this is a required class I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li>I enjoyed Dr. Hou's lectures and appreciated his effort to engage the class with relevant information before we went into the lab.</li>
    <li>Dr. Hou communicated his expectations regarding both individual and group lab reports. He informed us of mistakes and areas of improvement before taking significant points off of our reports. There was a learning curve and he gave the students the chance to do so without significantly suffering grades.</li>
    <li>The labs were well-made, and had good instruction on how to report the findings in the post-lab report.</li>
    <li>I think the lectures were great but I think he makes the questions for the finals a bit much. </li>
    <li>I learned a lot about important things for my future!</li>
    <li>The course went smoothly and I feel like we learned a ton of information that will be useful in the industry.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>"In lectures with Dr. Hou, he was clear in his explanation of concepts."</li>
    <li>"The instructor is very good at teaching the material and giving feedback on the reports."</li>
    <li>"Hou was polite and decent at lecturing. He was happy to answer questions even if the class was not always super interested in the course material ... His lectures were my favorite of the course. I would recommend him to someone taking the lab lectures."</li>
    <li>"I think everything was very organized and helped my learning."</li>
    <li>"There were a few fun labs during this course. The inorganic labs that dealt with ceramic processing and mechanical testing were extremely fun and really helped students to understand more about the course and the practices of engineers in industry."</li>

Glad to know the SmartLab SE System from Rigaku was established at IMRI, UL Lafayette. Dr. Hou led the configuration and acquisition effort in 2023 (supported by Louisiana BoRSF) and is proud to have made it happen. To the best of our knowledge, <u>for the first time universities in Louisiana</u> can conduct in situ and operando Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analyses dedicated to disordered materials on campus.<br>

&bull;&nbsp;Dr. Hou organized a symposium "Energy Storage Systems: In-Situ Characterization Studies", with Dr. Yijin Liu from UT Austin. The symposium was hosted at the ACS Spring 2024 meeting for Energy and Fuels Division (ENFL) in New Orleans, LA.<br>
&bull;&nbsp;With a theme of "Many Flavors of Chemistry", this conference has 29 technical divisions, 11779 accepted abstracts, including 7389 oral and 4390 poster presentations. We thoroughly enjoyed the conference.<br>
