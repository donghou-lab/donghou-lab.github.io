## <i class="fa fa-feather-alt fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;About Me
🎓 I received my Ph.D. from North Carolina State University, and my Bachelor's degree from Central South University in China. The majority of my postdoctoral training was at Virginia Tech. <a href="/bio/index.html">More about me</a><br>
🔬 My personal research interests include energy science, crystallography, microscopy, electrochemistry, manufacturing, and data science.<br>
📘 I love teaching. <a href="/teaching/index.html">Courses and Outreach</a><br>

## <i class="fa fa-layer-group fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Research Lab
At <b><em>DHLab</em></b>, our research aims to understand and control material properties for electrochemical energy applications, while advancing the fundamental knowledge of materials electrochemistry and solid-state physics. Our projects span the design, synthesis, processing, characterization, and application of cutting-edge energy materials, including those used in batteries, catalysis, ferroelectrics, and capacitors.<br>
