## <i class="fa fa-feather-alt fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;About Me
üéì I received my Ph.D. from North Carolina State University, and my Bachelor's degree from Central South University in China. The majority of my postdoctoral training was at Virginia Tech. <a href="/bio/index.html">More about me</a><br>
üî¨ My personal research interests include energy science, crystallography, microscopy, electrochemistry, manufacturing, and data science.<br>
üìò I love teaching. <a href="/teaching/index.html">Courses and Outreach</a><br>

## <i class="fa fa-layer-group fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Research Lab
For <b><em>DHLab</em></b>, the research goal is to understand and control materials properties for electrochemical energy applications, as well as to contribute to the fundamental progress of materials electrochemistry and solid-state physics. The research projects cover the design and synthesis, processing, characterization, and applications of energy materials (e.g., batteries, catalysis, ferroelectrics, and capacitors).<br>
